# Face-Recognition-Using-Python

# Overview
This project implements real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV and Python. It uses Haar cascade classifiers to detect faces from a live webcam feed. The project can be extended to include deep learning-based facial recognition using models like FaceNet, dlib, or OpenCV's LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) recognizer.

Key Features:
- Live face detection using OpenCV
- Uses Haar cascades for face detection
- Can be extended to recognize known faces
- Real-time processing for multiple faces

# Objectives
The goal of this project is to:
- Develop a real-time face detection system using OpenCV and Python.
- Implement Haar cascade classifiers for facial feature detection.
- Optimize the model for efficiency and accuracy in real-time applications.
- Extend the project to include face recognition using deep learning.
- Provide a modular and scalable codebase for further enhancements.
