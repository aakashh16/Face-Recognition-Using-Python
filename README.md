# Face-Recognition-Using-Python

# Overview
This project implements real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV and Python. It uses Haar cascade classifiers to detect faces from a live webcam feed. The project can be extended to include deep learning-based facial recognition using models like FaceNet, dlib, or OpenCV's LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) recognizer.

Key Features:

Live face detection using OpenCV
Uses Haar cascades for face detection
Can be extended to recognize known faces
Real-time processing for multiple faces
